# work_samples
1) All (sub) folders of this repository has a "readmefirst.txt" file, so please
handle it as it's named. ;-)

2) Content of this repository is in chronological order:

2a) final (HTML) project of my "HAK-IT Kolleg" finished end of June 2006

2b) few files from my "private" project of the online voting system "tiere2015" -
not finished yet

2c) FSWD stands for Full Stack Web Developer and it was one of the last homeworks
in the course, before we started our final projects (in a team of 4 people, each -
duration: 8.5 days), finished on 14. August 2019.

3) For the first 2 work samples your German should be at, I think, B2, at least.
